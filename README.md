# PhoneFallDetector
App sends an email when the phone falls down. The fall must be at least from around 50cm, otherwise the app will ignore it as false alarm. Waving your hand with the phone will probably not work, unless you managed to wave it with the acceleration of gravity towards ground.

The email account of the sender must be a gmail account, the email of the recipient can be anything.

The user must allow the appliction to use Internet and Location services.

When you run the app just enter the required information and click on the "Save and start" button. Then the app will start the sensor and besides listening for a fall it will also show you the sensor values.
